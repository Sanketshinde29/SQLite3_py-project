# 📊 SQLite3 Sales Data Project with Python
This project shows how to build a simple sales tracking system using SQLite3 and Python. It includes operations like inserting product data, performing SQL calculations (SUM, AVG), retrieving records, and creating data visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

# 🧠 Features
✅ Create an SQLite3 database and sales table
✅ Insert product sales data (name, price, quantity sold)
✅ Perform SQL operations:
                          SUM() – Total revenue
                          AVG() – Average price or sales
                          SELECT queries to retrieve data
✅ Generate data visualizations:
                                Bar chart of total units sold per product
                                Revenue chart per product
                                Scatter plot: Price vs Sales
                                Pie chart: Revenue share
# 🗃️ Technologies Used
**Python 3
SQLite3 (built-in database)
Matplotlib and Seaborn (for plotting)
SQL operations like:**
1.SUM()
2.AVG()
3.GROUP BY
4.ORDER BY

# 📈 Sample Graphs
Examples include:
total_sales by name.
revenue by product.
revenue_share by product.
